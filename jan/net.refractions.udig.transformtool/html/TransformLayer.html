<h1>Transform Tool</h1>
<p>
Transform Tool is the tool for transforming layers using several transformations 
methods. This tool can be found under <b>Tools > Other > TransformTool</b> in the main 
<b> Workbench </b> window.

<p>
It is necessary to setup the <b>Source layer</b> - the layer to be transformed. 
If there is no yet any vector layer it will be generated automatically.
</p>
<p>
<b>Vector layer</b> means the layer containing  just LineStrings formed by two points
 that represents the source and destination pair of points for transformation.
  Once you have this layer you can reused/edit it as any other Layer. For easiest control
   you can use <b>Add Vectors</b> button that let you
   specify the vectors. When you will leave the field empty and start adding the vectors 
   the temporary vector layer will be generated automatically. 
   </p>
   
  <p>
When the vector layer is done you can choose the transformation method.
 (Remember that the similar transformation needs at least two vectors and the 
 affine needs three). When you choose the method you can view the Transformation
  info and apply the transformation by click the <i>Transform</i> button.
